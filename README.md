Iâ€™m excited about how technology continues to shape the world, and Iâ€™m learning something new every day to be part of that change. Coming from a background with limited access to tech resources, Iâ€™ve been teaching myself coding, building projects, and using what I learn to help others â€” just like I was helped when I started.
